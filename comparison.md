# Comparing Two Approaches to Calling Multiple API Services: A Mathematical Perspective

When integrating with multiple API services, developers often encounter the challenge of handling failures. Two common strategies to ensure reliability involve retry mechanisms, but they approach the problem differently. This article compares these two strategies:

1. **Strategy 1: Bulk Retry**
2. **Strategy 2: Individual Retry**

We'll evaluate these approaches by considering their mathematical probabilities of success and practical implications.

## Strategy 1: Bulk Retry

In this approach, all API services are called in a batch. If any API call fails, the entire process is repeated up to two more times (three attempts in total).

### Example Scenario

Assume we have three API services: A, B, and C. Each API call has an independent success probability, denoted as $$\( P_A \), \( P_B \), and \( P_C \)$$ respectively.

### Mathematical Analysis

Let's denote the probability of an individual API call failing as $$\( F_i = 1 - P_i \)$$. The probability of all API calls succeeding in one batch is:
$$\[ P_{\text{batch}} = P_A \times P_B \times P_C \]$$

The probability of the batch failing in one attempt is:
$$\[ F_{\text{batch}} = 1 - P_{\text{batch}} = 1 - (P_A \times P_B \times P_C) \]$$

Given that we retry the batch up to two more times if it fails, the probability of the batch succeeding in three attempts is:
$$\[ P_{\text{success\_bulk}} = 1 - (F_{\text{batch}})^3 \]$$

### Numerical Example

Suppose the success probabilities for the API calls are:
- $$( P_A = 0.6 \)$$
- $$\( P_B = 0.5 \)$$
- $$\( P_C = 0.55 \)$$

First, calculate \( P_{\text{batch}} \):
$$\[ P_{\text{batch}} = 0.6 \times 0.5 \times 0.55 = 0.165 \]$$

Then, calculate \( F_{\text{batch}} \):
$$\[ F_{\text{batch}} = 1 - 0.165 = 0.835 \]$$

Finally, calculate \( P_{\text{success\_bulk}} \):
$$\[ P_{\text{success\_bulk}} = 1 - (0.835)^3 = 1 - 0.582 = 0.418 \]$$

## Strategy 2: Individual Retry

In this approach, each API service is called individually with up to two retries before moving to the next service.

### Example Scenario

Using the same three API services (A, B, and C) with their respective success probabilities $$\( P_A \), \( P_B \), and \( P_C \)$$.

### Mathematical Analysis

The probability of successfully calling an individual API service in up to three attempts is:
$$\[ P_{\text{success\_individual}} = 1 - (F_i)^3 \]$$

The overall probability of success for all three services is the product of their individual success probabilities:
$$\[ P_{\text{success\_total}} = P_{\text{success\_A}} \times P_{\text{success\_B}} \times P_{\text{success\_C}} \]$$

Where:
$$\[ P_{\text{success\_A}} = 1 - (F_A)^3 \]$$
$$\[ P_{\text{success\_B}} = 1 - (F_B)^3 \]$$
$$\[ P_{\text{success\_C}} = 1 - (F_C)^3 \]$$

### Numerical Example

Given the same success probabilities for individual API calls:
- $$( P_A = 0.6 \)$$
- \( P_B = 0.5 \)
- \( P_C = 0.55 \)

Calculate the success probabilities with retries:
\[ P_{\text{success\_A}} = 1 - (0.4)^3 = 1 - 0.064 = 0.936 \]
\[ P_{\text{success\_B}} = 1 - (0.5)^3 = 1 - 0.125 = 0.875 \]
\[ P_{\text{success\_C}} = 1 - (0.45)^3 = 1 - 0.091125 = 0.908875 \]

Then, calculate the overall success probability:
\[ P_{\text{success\_total}} = 0.936 \times 0.875 \times 0.908875 \approx 0.744 \]

## Comparison and Conclusion

With the lower success rates, the difference between the two strategies becomes even more pronounced:

- **Bulk Retry Strategy**: The probability of success is approximately 0.418.
- **Individual Retry Strategy**: The probability of success is approximately 0.744.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Higher Success Rate**: The Individual Retry Strategy still provides a higher probability of overall success (0.744) compared to the Bulk Retry Strategy (0.418). This demonstrates that even with lower individual success rates, the Individual Retry Strategy is more robust.
2. **Failure Isolation**: The Individual Retry Strategy's advantage of isolating failures becomes more critical as the likelihood of individual call failures increases.
3. **Efficiency**: The efficiency gains from not having to retry all calls in a batch when only one fails are more significant when success rates are lower.

In scenarios where API services have lower individual success rates, the Individual Retry Strategy is even more advantageous, providing a significantly higher overall success probability and ensuring better handling of failures. This makes the Individual Retry Strategy a more reliable and efficient choice, especially in environments where network reliability and service robustness are concerns.
